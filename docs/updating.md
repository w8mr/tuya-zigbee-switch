# Updating OTA

This page describes **converting** and **updating** supported devices **wirelessly.**  
***Zigbee2MQTT is heavily recommended.** ZHA can't re-interview and update pinouts.*

> [!CAUTION]  
> The main branch is generally safe. However, bugs in the code **can brick your device**.  
> - Recover or restore: [flashing/](./flashing/)  
> - Restoring the original FW requires a memory dump of the stock device: [`bin/_factory/`](../bin/_factory/)

- To receive custom FW updates, your ZHA / Z2M instance must have a **custom OTA index** applied.  
- To use the new features, you must **download and regularly update the quirks / converters**.  

## Conversion

**Original fw ➡ custom fw** update steps (only Telink devices):  

1. Find your device on [supported_devices.md](./supported_devices.md)
2. Read [known_issues.md](./known_issues.md)
3. **Download** the custom [# Quirks / Converters](#quirks--converters)
4. **Apply** the preferred [# OTA index](#ota-index) (not FORCE)
5. **Restart** HA / Z2M
6. Bring the device closer to the coordinator, or add routers to **boost signal**  
(Pairing requires stronger signal than normal usage)
7. Optionally, tweak Z2M settings for [# Faster OTA updates](#faster-ota-updates)
8. **Start** the update (can get stuck at 100% - it's ok)
9. **Permit join** when it's done (LED blinks if mapped correctly)
10. **Interview** the device **`i`**  
⤷ option missing from ZHA, remove and re-pair if needed  
11. **Reconfigure** the device **`🗘`** 
12. Be aware of [## Version update](#version-update) steps
13. Read [faq.md](./faq.md) before reaching out for support

> Hopefully, you now have a working device with custom firmware! 😊  
> *Consider yourself invited to our [Discord](/readme.md#discord) community!* 

## Version update

**Custom fw ➡ custom fw** update steps (all devices):

1. Check if you have the correct [# OTA index](#ota-index)
2. Read [changelog_fw.md](./changelog_fw.md)
3. Remember your configurations and binds  
(In case update erases them - mentioned in step 2)
4. Ensure **strong signal**  
5. Optionally, tweak Z2M settings for [# Faster OTA updates](#faster-ota-updates)
6. **Update** the device
7. **Re-download** the custom [# Quirks / Converters](#quirks--converters) and restart ZHA / Z2M
8. **Interview** the device **`i`**  
⤷ option missing from ZHA, remove and re-pair if needed  
(updates endpoints, clusters and identifiers)
9. **Reconfigure** the device **`🗘`**  
(resets reporting and stuff?, keeps user binds and settings)
10. Re-do user settings if needed

> *If your device is several versions behind, it will update directly to the latest version.*

# OTA index

The index points to the firmware images.  
We use a link to the latest index (so it's always up-to-date).  

### Changing the index

<details>
<summary> Z2M</summary>  

Apply custom index in the user interface and **restart Z2M:**  
**Z2M ➡ Settings ➡ OTA updates ➡ OTA index override file name**  

Or in `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
ota:
  zigbee_ota_override_index_location: >-
    LINK_OR_PATH
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> ZHA </summary>  

Edit `homeassistant/configuration.yaml` and **restart HA**:  
(More details: [#62][zha_tips])

```yaml
zha:
  enable_quirks: true
  custom_quirks_path: ./custom_zha_quirks/
  zigpy_config:
    ota:
      extra_providers:
        - type: z2m
          url: LINK_OR_PATH
```

</details>

### Choosing an index

- You can install **Router** or **EndDevice** firmware
- Switch between them by re-installing (update again with FORCE index)
- **Router is recommended** - draws more power, but works even for L-only devices  

> L-only switches need a big load to function (usually on L1 - consult manual).  
> ⤷ Estimated values: >3W for end_device, >8W for router  
> *They may not work at all with smart bulbs (<1W when brightness=0)*

<summary> <b> Index link format </b> </summary>  

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USER/REPO/refs/heads/BRANCH/zigbee2mqtt/ota/INDEX
```
</details>
<br>

The available indexes **for the main branch** are:  

<details>
<summary> <code> index_router.json </code> </summary>  

- Both L and L+N switches get Router FW
- Both stock and custom FW devices receive updates
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romasku/tuya-zigbee-switch/refs/heads/main/zigbee2mqtt/ota/index_router.json
```
</details>

<details>
<summary> <code> index_router-FORCE.json </code> </summary>  

- Both L and L+N switches get Router FW
- Allows (re-installing FW with the same version number
- Only custom FW devices receive updates
- Useful for switching between operation modes or branches
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romasku/tuya-zigbee-switch/refs/heads/main/zigbee2mqtt/ota/index_router-FORCE.json
```
</details>

<details>
<summary> <code> index_end_device.json </code> </summary>  

- L-only switches get EndDevice FW
- L+N switches do not get anything
- Both stock and custom FW devices receive updates
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romasku/tuya-zigbee-switch/refs/heads/main/zigbee2mqtt/ota/index_end_device.json
```
</details>

<details>
<summary> <code> index_end_device-FORCE.json </code> </summary>  

- L-only switches get EndDevice FW
- L+N switches do not get anything
- Allows re-installing FW with the same version number
- Only custom FW devices receive updates
- Useful for switching between operation modes or branches
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romasku/tuya-zigbee-switch/refs/heads/main/zigbee2mqtt/ota/index_end_device-FORCE.json
```
</details>

> [!NOTE]  
> The custom OTA index appends to the original Z2M index.  
> So your other Zigbee devices will still receive updates normally.

### Faster OTA updates

By default, updates perform slowly to put less strain on the network and ensure stability.  
If your device has good signal and the network is not being actively used, you can lower the duration:

Go to **Z2M ➡ Settings ➡ OTA updates** and tweak the values.  
*50B + 50ms takes less than 5 minutes on an empty network.* More info: [Z2M doc][z2m_ota_speed]

# Quirks / Converters

Custom quirks / converters:

- are needed for recognizing the device and exposing all supported features 

- can be updated independently of fw updates (e.g. support new devices)

- are generally backwards-compatible (Use the latest files)

- are not yet submitted to [ZHA][zha-device-handlers] and [Z2M][zigbee-herdsman-converters]  
**⤷ manually download and update them**

### Download

<details>
<summary> ZHA steps </summary>  

1. (Re)download them from [`zha/`][quirks] (main branch)  
2. (Re)place them in `homeassistant/custom_zha_quirks/`  
3. Specify the custom quirks path in the configuration file (see [# OTA index](#ota-index))
4. Restart HA to apply
5. Reconfigure device (does not remove user settings or binds)

</details>

<details>
<summary> Z2M steps </summary>  

1. (Re)download them from [`zigbee2mqtt/converters/`][converters] (main branch)  
2. Create the `external_converters/` folder in `zigbee2mqtt/` or `data/`  
_The path differs depending on version/installation method. The parent folder must already exist._  
The new folder should be at the same level with coordinator_backup.json.  
3. (Re)place them in `external_converters/`
4. Restart Z2M to apply
5. Interview + reconfigure device (does not remove user settings or binds)
